This project is a React app bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)  for the purpose of learning and explaining some basic React JS (v16) concepts.

Please clone the repository and run following commands

`npm install` - This installs all the project dependencies found in `package.json`
`npm run start` - This will start your server

The App is suppose to help its client track stock markets data. It has a feature to enable livestreaming which will update data every 3 seconds. It also allows you to toggle between viewing all stocks data and only your stocks.

There is no backend to this app. Currently dummy data is created by `src/service.js` with a minor variation everytime to give a feel of dynamically changing data.

*React.js Rocks. Happy Coding!*
